# Computational-physics
During my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Coimbra, I had the opportunity to develop numerous Python programs for the Computational Physics course. These programs were specifically crafted to address a wide range of challenging physics problems. As I delved into the world of computational techniques and numerical methods, I discovered the immense power of Python in simulating and analyzing complex physical phenomena. These programs became invaluable tools in my journey to unravel the mysteries of the universe, providing me with unique insights and a deeper understanding of the subject. Through this experience, I not only sharpened my coding skills but also developed a profound appreciation for the beautiful marriage between physics and computer science.

## Content 

### 1_ex4
Simulation of coin fliping using Binominal Distribution

### 1_ex5
Same as the ex4 but it sums all the probabilities from 0 to n to check that gives the correct result of 1.

### 1_ex6
More efficient way to do ex4.

### 1_ex7
Program optimized to work with large numbers.

### 2_ex1
Bisection, Secant and Newton's methods to calculate the derivative of a function. 

### 2_ex3
Program that uses the methods to reach a desire precision. 

### 3_ex1
Propagation of error and result presentation.

### 3_ex2
Program that acesses a database, dowloads the data and then treats the data and plot it. 

### 4_ex1
Determines an integral using rectangle, trapezoid and Simpson methods.

### 4_ex2
Uses/Try the three methods to reach a relative error less than 1% for each method.

### 5_ex1
Simulation of nuclear decay

### 5_ex2
Same but with diferrent parameters

### 5_ex3
Again with different parameters

### 5_ex4
Simulation of nuclear decay considering a chain decay. 

### 6_ex1
Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the integral bethween a and b, and it compares the result with the Simpson method. 

### 6_ex2
Some changes to make the program work with negative values.

### 7_ex1
Solves system of n linear equations by the Gaussian elimination method. 

### 7_ex2
Same method but solves 100 equations that are in a database

### 7_ex3 
It finds the inverse square Matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

### 7_ex4
Solves a system of equations that are in a data base, without pivoting and after solves again with pivoting. 

### 8_ex1
Finds the first and second derivative using the 3-point and 5-point rule. 

### 8_ex2
Determines a derivative using 3 point rule and then uses the value in Newtons method, the program chooses the h step. 

### 9 _ex1
Solves the initial value problem using Euler's method. 

### 9_ex2
Numerically solves the diferential equation using Euler's method. 

### 9_ex3s
Same but uses Heun's method. 

### 10_ex1
Aproximate a data set to a polynomial of degree n, uses Gaussian elimination and ask's if user want to use pivoting. Plots the data set and the obtain fit. 

### 10_ex2
Uses the previous program and applies it to a data set from a data base. 

### 11
Access a data base with data from the courteau99 to demonstrate the Tuly-Fisher relation. Plots the selected data, determines the parameters of the best line, join the line to the graph, determine the correlation coefficient, test the hypothesis of a correlation with cofident level of 95% and determine the error of the slope factor with  95% confident level.
