# Computational-physics
During my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Coimbra, I had the opportunity to develop numerous Python programs for the Computational Physics course. These programs were specifically crafted to address a wide range of challenging physics problems. As I delved into the world of computational techniques and numerical methods, I discovered the immense power of Python in simulating and analyzing complex physical phenomena. These programs became invaluable tools in my journey to unravel the mysteries of the universe, providing me with unique insights and a deeper understanding of the subject. Through this experience, I not only sharpened my coding skills but also developed a profound appreciation for the beautiful marriage between physics and computer science.
